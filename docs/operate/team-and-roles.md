# Team, roles & tokens

The dashboard's **Settings** has three sub-pages accessible from the left nav.

## Default

The page every member opens first. Its profile settings (nickname, avatar, password) are the same for everyone and are described in [For teammates](/get-started/teammates#profile). Two more sections appear by role:

- **Workspace** — the team name and logo. Visible to Admins only.
- **Apps** — rename or delete apps. Visible to Admins, Developers and QA, hidden from Viewers.

## Team

Visible to **Admin** only.

- **Members list** — all accounts with email, role, and join date.
- **Invite member** — send an email invite or generate a copy-paste link. Invites expire after 7 days.
- **Change role** — reassign any member's role (Admin / Developer / QA / Viewer).
- **Remove member** — permanently deletes the account. The member is signed out everywhere at once, and their open device sessions and any agents connected with their tokens are disconnected. You cannot remove yourself.
- **Reset pwd** — create a password reset link for a member. The link appears in a dialog to copy and share, and is also emailed when SMTP is configured. It works once, for 2 hours, and making a new one turns off the earlier one. The reset signs the member out everywhere and revokes all of their personal access tokens, CI and agent tokens included, so agents using those tokens disconnect until new tokens are issued. This matters most when an Admin resets their own account, because agent tokens belong to Admins. A password change in **Settings** keeps tokens.

## Invite teammates {#invite-teammates}

Once signed in as Admin, go to **Settings → Team** and create invite links:

1. Click **Invite member**.
2. Enter the team member's email and select a role. The role defaults to **QA**.
   - **Admin** — can do everything except remove their own account. Inviting members, changing roles, removing members, resetting passwords, workspace settings and issuing **Agent** tokens are Admin-only.
   - **Developer**, **QA** — can add, edit and delete apps, upload builds, change a build's status, schedule build deletion, manage webhooks and create their own API tokens in **Settings → Tokens**. The two roles have the same permissions.
   - **Viewer** — read-only. Can view builds, test them on a simulator or emulator in a QA Session, and comment. Cannot change builds or apps, and can neither see nor change webhooks.

   Commenting and starting sessions are open to every signed-in member, whatever their role. A role change applies right away to the API endpoints that check roles, without the member signing in again.
3. Click **Generate invite link**. The link appears in the dialog, and is also copied to your clipboard when the browser allows it. If SMTP is configured, the member also receives an invite email with a link to set their password. An email that already belongs to a member is refused, and the dialog says so under the email field.

When you opened the dashboard at `localhost` on the relay host, the invite link carries the relay host's LAN address. A relay inside a Docker container cannot know its LAN address, so the link uses the address in your browser's address bar. When a tunnel or `relay.url` is configured, the link uses that address. If SMTP isn't configured, copy the link shown in the dialog and share it directly; see [Configuration](/reference/configuration) to set up SMTP. What an invited teammate does next is in [For teammates](/get-started/teammates).

## Tokens

Personal access tokens (PATs) for CI/CD scripts and API access. The sidebar shows this page to **Admin**, **Developer** and **QA**; each member sees and revokes only their own tokens. The **Agent** type is offered to Admins only.

- **New token** — enter a name, an **Expiration**, and a Type. Choose 7, 30, 60 or 90 days, a custom number (1–365 days), or **No expiration**; the default is 30 days. A token with no expiration stays valid until you revoke it, so keep CI tokens to 90 days or less. The list marks these tokens **No expiration** so you can find and clean them up. **API** is for CI uploads and API access (scope `view, builds:write`); **Agent** connects remote Mac agents. The token is shown once — copy it immediately.
- **Revoke** — instantly invalidates the token.

Use PATs with the `Authorization: Bearer tflw_pat_<token>` header to upload builds from CI. See [Upload from CI](/operate/ci-distribution).
